# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**
The project is a webpage displaying different destinations in the U.S. with a profile of choice. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

Some techniques that were used include: media queries to add responsive webpage design, minmax() function to adjust the gaps as the window width decreases, and display grid to evenly space the gaps of the cards in a grid-like format.
Some technologies that were used include: Figma to examine the layout of the design templates for both desktop and mobile and the inspect option in Google Chrome to test some CSS properties adjustments.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
